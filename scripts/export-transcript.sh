# Auto-export the current Claude Code session transcript into prompts/.
#
# Wired as a Stop + SessionEnd hook in .claude/settings.json. Claude Code hands
# the hook a JSON payload on stdin that carries `transcript_path` and
# `session_id`; this copies that transcript to prompts/raw-session-<id>.jsonl.
#
# Why it's here: the take-home asks you to commit your raw AI session logs to
# prompts/ — we read them as the source of truth. This removes the manual step:
# every time Claude Code stops or the session ends, the latest full transcript
# is copied in, overwriting the same per-session file. Idempotent; re-running is
# safe, so prompts/ always holds the current transcript for each session.
#
# Non-fatal by design: any failure exits 0 so it can never interrupt your work.
# Only fires under Claude Code. On Cursor / Codex / another tool, export your
# transcript into prompts/ by hand (see PROMPTS.md) — same destination.
